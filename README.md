Java Wrapper for the zukijourney API.

This repository aims to be a useful collection of Java modules that make using the zukijourney API easier.

To use this wrapper, the bare-mimum files you need are the pom.xml file and the Modules folder. Alternatively, you may download the .zip file for this repo or clone this repo via the CLI.

The file Main.java has some example code on how to use the wrapper. The .gitignore file is there to ignore the .idea, .iml and target folders when making commits, as this wrapper was primarily developed using IntelliJ IDEA.

Currently, this repository is only meant to be used for chat completions, namely the OpenAI models.

While the concept of a zukijourney API might be no different than an OpenAI Java wrapper, there are specific quirks of the zukijourney API that this repository handles which make it more accessible.
